# Analyzing the Netgear EX6100

A few weeks ago, I purchased a Netgear EX6100 for $5 at a local garage sale. Score!

The device has reached end of life, and as such has not received any software updates since July, 2020 - uh oh!

I decided it likely wasn't smart to add it to my home network, so instead, it became a new toy for security research! :)

**Note:** This repository will likely be a continual work-in-progress, as this is something I'm only poking at in my free time. Feel free to reach out directly or open an issue if you have any questions or comments!

## Current TODO List

- Research public CVEs
- Download firmware for static analysis
- Research device specs and architecture
- Disassemble device for hardware analysis/testing
- Have fun!
